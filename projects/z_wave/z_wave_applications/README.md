# Silicon Labs Z-Wave Applications #

[Z-Wave Application Examples](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/z_wave_applications) has already been featured for everyone as a great introduction.

Silicon Labs Z-Wave solutions offer everything you need—hardware and software—for building smart, secure home devices like locks, thermostats, switches, and sensors. The Z-Wave stack handles the protocol so you can focus on your application.
