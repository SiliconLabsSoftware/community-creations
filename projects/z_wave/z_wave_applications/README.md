# Silicon Labs Z-Wave Applications #

The Silicon Labs Z-Wave wireless solutions are end-to-end solutions with software and hardware building blocks for both controllers and end devices for home security and smart home devices including door locks, thermostats, shades, switches, and sensors. Z-Wave software provides the foundational features required in the Z-Wave specification and enables you to focus on your application with no need to be a protocol expert.

We encourage the community to contribute their own Z-Wave protocol projects, share technical insights, and collaborate to enhance the available resources. Your participation—whether through submitting new projects, refining documentation, or offering feedback—helps strengthen the ecosystem and supports developers working with Z-Wave wireless technologies.

## Requirements ##

1. Silicon Labs devices that supports Z-Wave
2. Simplicity Studio 5
3. Compatible SDK version, you can install it via Simplicity Studio or download it from our GitHub [gecko_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk) or [simplicity_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/simplicity_sdk)
