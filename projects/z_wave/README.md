# Silicon Labs Z-Wave Applications #

Z-Wave is a wireless communication standard largely used for home and business automation. It is a mesh network that communicates between devices using low-energy radio waves, enabling wireless management of smart home equipment such as smart lighting, security systems, thermostats, sensors, smart door locks, and garage door openers.

This repository is dedicated to the communityâ€”created by developers, for developers. Here, you can find, share, and contribute Z-Wave application examples, best practices, and innovative ideas. We encourage you to participate by submitting your own projects, improvements, and feedback. Together, we can accelerate development, solve challenges, and inspire new solutions for Z-Wave-enabled devices. Join the conversation, collaborate, and help grow a vibrant ecosystem around Silicon Labs Z-Wave technology!
