# Silicon Labs WiSun Applications #

Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN) is the leading IPv6 sub-GHz mesh technology for smart city and smart utility applications. Silicon Labs' Wi-SUN SDK includes industry-leading software stacks and development tools for Wi-SUN end nodes and border routers. In conjunction with SoCs and reference applications for Wi-SUN, developers can use software and tools from Silicon Labs to quickly and reliably:

- Develop multi-node mesh networks
- Monitor and debug multiple nodes simultaneously
- Visually analyze system performance

This repository is dedicated to the communityâ€”created by developers, for developers. Here, you can find, share, and contribute Wi-Fi application examples, best practices, and innovative ideas. We encourage you to participate by submitting your own projects, improvements, and feedback. Together, we can accelerate development, solve challenges, and inspire new solutions for Wi-Fi-enabled devices. Join the conversation, collaborate, and help grow a vibrant ecosystem around Silicon Labs Wi-Fi technology!
