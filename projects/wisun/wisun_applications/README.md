# Silicon Labs Wi-SUN Applications #

The Silicon Labs Wi-SUN stack allows for a wide variety applications to be built on its foundation. This repo showcases some example applications built using the Silicon Labs Wi-SUN stack.

## Examples ##

- [Wi-SUN Node Monitoring](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wisun_applications_staging/tree/main/wisun_node_monitoring): An extendable node monitoring application providing information on the device/board/application and connected statistics. It can be easily extended to monitor sensors and control actuators.
- [Wi-SUN SoC CSMP Agent Skeleton](/wisun_soc_csmp_agent/): A reference implementation of the CSMP agent sample application skeleton that can be built using the [csmp-agent-lib](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/csmp-agent-lib) build system, to allow a node to connect to FND.

## Add the 'Wi-SUN Applications' Repository to Simplicity Studio 5 ##

1. Download and install [Simplicity Studio 5](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio).
2. On Simplicity Studio 5, go to **Window -> Preferences -> Simplicity Studio -> External Repos**.
3. Click **[Add]**. In the **URI** field, copy & paste the following link: `https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wisun_applications.git`
4. Click **[Next]** then **[Finish]** and **[Apply and Close]**.

## Create the Wi-SUN Applications Example Projects ##

1. Connect the Silicon Labs Starter Kit and open Simplicity Studio 5.
2. Select the **[Launcher]** perspective.
3. From the **[Debug Adapters]** panel on the left top corner, select your Silicon Labs Starter Kit.
4. Ensure that an SDK is selected in the **[General Information]** tile of the **[Overview]** tab.
5. Select the **[EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS]** tab in **[Launcher]** perspective.
6. Under **Provider** (at the bottom of the list), select **wisun_applications** and click **[create]** on the desired project.
   1. If the project you are looking for is not listed in **wisun_applications**, it is possible that your debug adapter is not listed as compatible with the application. Try using a Silicon Labs debug adapter first, and check if it is listed in the project's **boardCompatibility** section of [templates.xml](templates.xml).

## Using Wi-SUN Crash Handler in Another Project ##

Wi-SUN Node Monitoring application contains a crash handler component that reports and recovers from application asserts and crashes.

In order to utilize the component in another project:

1. Copy **sl_wisun_crash_handler.c** and **sl_wisun_crash_handler.h** to the project, and add them to compilation.
2. Add RMU (emlib_rmu) component to the project.
3. Add linker flags below to the project. In Studio, go to **Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> GNU ARM C Linker -> Miscellaneous**. The component will work without them, but it will be unable to capture some asserts on GCC.

```text
    -Wl,--wrap=__stack_chk_fail,--wrap=__assert_func
```

4. Call crash handler initialization in **app_init**.

```C
  #include "sl_wisun_crash_handler.h"
  ...
  void app_init(void)
  {
    sl_wisun_crash_handler_init();
  }
```

5. After initialization, read crash reason.

```C
  #include "sl_wisun_crash_handler.h"
  ...
  const sl_wisun_crash_t *crash;
  ...
  crash = sl_wisun_crash_handler_read();
  if (crash) {
    switch (crash->type) {
      case SL_WISUN_CRASH_TYPE_XXX:
        break;
      ...
    }
    sl_wisun_crash_handler_clear();
  }
```

6. Alternatively, call `sl_wisun_check_previous_crash()` to fill the `crash_info_string` then print the string. This string will be available during the entire application runtime (the Wi-SUN Node Monitoring application makes it available via a CoAP request).

```C
  #include "sl_wisun_crash_handler.h"
  ...
  int crash_type;
  ...
  crash_type = sl_wisun_check_previous_crash();
  if (crash_type) {
    printf("%s\n", crash_info_string);
  }
```

> [!WARNING]
> If the project uses Gecko Bootloader, bootloader's bss section may overlap with application's noinit section, causing the crash handler to not function properly. In Wi-SUN Node Monitoring application this is avoided by increasing
> the stack size **SL_STACK_SIZE**, which pushes application's noinit section further into RAM. Another possibility is to modify the generated linker script and swap the placement of application's bss and noinit sections.

## Documentation ##

- Official Wi-SUN documentation can be found in [the Wi-SUN pages on docs.silabs.com](https://docs.silabs.com/wisun/latest/wisun-start/).
- Project-specific information is provided in the **README.md** file in each project folder.

## Reporting Bugs/Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##
