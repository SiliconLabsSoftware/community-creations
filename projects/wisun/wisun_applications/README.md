# Silicon Labs Wi-Sun Applications #

[Wisun Application Examples](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wisun_applications) is a good starting point to be referred.

In smart grid and smart city applications, a long-range, dependable mesh topology is essential for building a resilient wide area network that is more immune to interference than other topologies. Silicon Labs' Wi-Sun solutions include a pin-to-pin compatible wireless MCU family that allows for low-power, cost-effective communication in large-scale outdoor networks with thousands of nodes.

WiSun offers a powerful platform for building innovative, cross-device solutions. We encourage you to share your projects, insights, and best practices. Your contributions help advance the ecosystem and support others tackling similar challenges.

## Requirements ##
