# Silicon Labs Zigbee Application Examples #

Silicon Labs devices support Zigbee, delivering reliable, low-power wireless connectivity for smart home, building automation, and industrial IoT applications—engineered for seamless interoperability, robust mesh networking, and future-ready Matter integration.

We urge the community to contribute their own Zigbee protocol projects, share technical insights, and work together to improve the existing materials. Your participation—whether by proposing new projects, improving documentation, or providing feedback—helps to grow the ecosystem and benefit developers working with Zigbee wireless technology.
