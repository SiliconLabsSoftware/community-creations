Concept Summary
The Research Platform demonstrates how a single low-power Seeed XIAO MG24 Sense module—with its integrated 6-axis IMU, analog microphone, BLE, and Cortex-M33 MCU—can serve as a versatile edge device for health, wellness, and industrial safety, reliability monitoring.
All five applications share the same sensing, wireless, and data-logging framework while differing only in firmware logic and analytics.
This was developed as part of a course in Medical Device Diagnostics Design and Manufacturing. The first lecture on this was delivered on October 20 at the St.Louis University, MO.
The project was originally started to encourage my LinkdIn followers to participate in the XIAO Competition.
Each module was presented in my LinkdIn posts to showcase and encourage.
The Basic Pack is designed for quick prototyping of Medical Device concepts for University Students.
Applications Demonstrated
	Module	Purpose	Key MG24 Sense Features Used	Output Visualization
1	Fall Detection	Detect sudden posture change or impact for elderly safety	IMU (accel + gyro)	Alert via BLE / MQTT → Node-RED dashboard
2	Equipment Vibration Monitor	Identify abnormal vibration patterns in machines	IMU (accel) + FFT analysis	RMS vibration trend & threshold alarm
3	Heart Rate Monitor	Derive heart-rate signal from subtle body motions or surface vibrations	Mic + low-freq IMU envelope	Real-time BPM gauge on GUI
4	Gait Analysis	Assess step symmetry & stability using multiple nodes	IMU fusion across sensors	Step-phase plot & asymmetry index
5	Sleep Monitoring	Detect restlessness, position shifts, and respiration motion	IMU (low freq band)	Sleep-movement score and timeline
