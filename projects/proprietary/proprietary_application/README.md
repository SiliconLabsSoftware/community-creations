# Silicon Labs Proprietary Applications #

This repository contains proprietary application projects designed to demonstrate the advanced features and capabilities of Silicon Labs EFR32 devices. Each project highlights real-world use cases, integration methods, and best practices for developing secure and efficient proprietary wireless solutions on Silicon Labs hardware.

We encourage the community to contribute their own proprietary protocol projects, share technical insights, and collaborate to enhance the available resources. Your participation—whether through submitting new projects, refining documentation, or offering feedback—helps strengthen the ecosystem and supports developers working with proprietary wireless technologies.

Browse the available projects to accelerate your proprietary application development, deepen your understanding of the platform, and engage with other developers in the Silicon Labs community.

## Requirements ##

1. Silicon Labs EFR32 Development Kit
2. Simplicity Studio 5
3. Compatible SDK version, you can install it via Simplicity Studio or download it from our GitHub [gecko_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk) or [simplicity_sdk](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/simplicity_sdk)

## Project structure ##

* **device_root**
  * This folder contains all of the required files to run the project. The files and folders should be copied into the root folder of the device.
  * **lib**
    * The lib folder contains precompiled libraries provided by Adafruit, this folder provides the application logic related files too. These libraries and files are required to run the project.
