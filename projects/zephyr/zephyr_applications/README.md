# Silicon Labs Zephyr Applications #

Zephyr is a lightweight, open-source RTOS from the Linux Foundation, built for low-power, resource-constrained devices. With support for Ethernet, Bluetooth, and multiple architectures like Arm, x86, and RISC-V, it’s a flexible choice for real-time embedded applications.

Silicon Labs have provided many examples for [Zephyr Application Examples](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/zephyr_applications).
We’d love to see what you build with Zephyr! Share your projects, tips, or feedback to help grow the community and support others working with this powerful platform.

## Requirements ##

1. Silicon Labs EFR32 development kit
