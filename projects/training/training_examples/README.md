# Silicon Labs Training #

This repository provides hands-on training examples for developing applications on Silicon Labs EFR32 devices. Each example is designed to teach key concepts, demonstrate integration techniques, and showcase best practices for building secure and efficient wireless solutions using Silicon Labs hardware.

We invite learners and contributors to explore these training projects, share their own examples, and collaborate to expand the collection. Whether you are submitting new training materials, improving documentation, or providing feedback, your involvement helps foster a stronger developer community.

Use these examples to accelerate your learning, gain practical experience with the platform, and connect with others working on Silicon Labs technologies.
