# Silicon Labs Wi-Fi Applications #

Silicon Labs Wi-Fi solutions, based on the SiWx91x family of SoCs and modules, enable a variety of wireless applications such as IoT devices, smart home products, and industrial automation. This repository is dedicated to community-created SLCP (Simplicity Studio Component Project) example applications that showcase essential Wi-Fi featuresâ€”including station and access point modes, secure TLS/SSL communication, cloud connectivity (MQTT, HTTP), OTA firmware updates, power management, and sensor or peripheral integration.

Community members are encouraged to contribute their own projects, share enhancements, and collaborate by submitting pull requests or opening issues. For setup instructions, hardware compatibility, and SDK requirements, refer to the README of each individual project.
