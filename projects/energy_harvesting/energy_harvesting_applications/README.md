# Silicon Labs Energy Harvesting Applications - Simplicity SDK Extension #


Silicon Labs provides a range of [Energy Harvesting Examples](https://github.com/SiliconLabsSoftware/energy_harvesting_applications) to help you explore practical implementations and accelerate your development process. These examples demonstrate key concepts and use cases, but they only scratch the surface of what’s possible. We encourage you to contribute your own projects and ideas—your insights can help expand the ecosystem, foster collaboration, and support others working on similar energy-efficient solutions.

This repository provides comprehensive documentation, demonstration projects, example applications, and all necessary source code for the Energy Harvesting extension for Silicon Labs devices. It is designed to be integrated with Silicon Labs Simplicity Studio, enabling developers to explore, evaluate, and build energy harvesting solutions using supported hardware and software tools. While you can browse the repository, it is recommended to access and use its content through Simplicity Studio for the best experience, as direct usage outside the IDE may not be fully supported.
