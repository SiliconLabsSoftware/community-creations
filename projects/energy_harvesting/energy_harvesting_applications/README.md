# Silicon Labs Energy Harvesting Applications - Simplicity SDK Extension #

This repository provides comprehensive documentation, demonstration projects, example applications, and all necessary source code for the Energy Harvesting extension for Silicon Labs devices. It is designed to be integrated with Silicon Labs Simplicity Studio, enabling developers to explore, evaluate, and build energy harvesting solutions using supported hardware and software tools. While you can browse the repository, it is recommended to access and use its content through Simplicity Studio for the best experience, as direct usage outside the IDE may not be fully supported.
