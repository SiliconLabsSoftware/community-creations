# Silicon Labs Energy Harvesting #

Silicon Labs' EFR32 devices empower developers to create advanced energy harvesting solutions for embedded systems. By leveraging ambient energy sources—such as light, vibration, or radio frequency—these devices can significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for traditional batteries. This repository is a community-driven collection of example applications, firmware, and reference designs that demonstrate how to implement energy harvesting with EFR32 devices.

Whether you are designing ultra-low-power wireless sensors, batteryless IoT nodes, or energy-aware peripherals, these resources provide practical guidance and proven techniques to accelerate your development. We encourage community members to contribute their own projects, share improvements, and collaborate through issues and pull requests. Together, we can expand the knowledge base and help others succeed with energy harvesting on EFR32 platforms.
