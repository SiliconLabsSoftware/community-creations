# Silicon Labs Open Hardware Prototypes #

Hardware design is a critical pillar of any embedded system, serving as the physical foundation upon which software operates. While software defines behavior and functionality, hardware determines the system's capabilities, performance, power efficiency, and reliability. A well-designed hardware platform ensures optimal integration with sensors, actuators, and communication interfaces, enabling the software to perform effectively in real-world conditions.

By sharing hardware resources alongside software, we aim to empower the community with a more holistic development environmentâ€”one that supports innovation from the circuit board to the application layer.

## Requirements ##

- PCB Design Software: Recommended to use [EasyEDA - PCB design software](https://easyeda.com/) for its simplicity and free of charge
- 3D printing design software
- 3D printer

> [!Tip]
> Try to include .3mf files (3D Manufacturing Format), which is a modern file format designed specifically for 3D printing. It contains not only the model geometry but also additional information such as color, material, and print settings. These files have been edited using Bambu Studio and successfully test-printed with the Bambu A1 3D printer. It also contains design files created and finalized in Fusion 360, which provide full design history and parametric features. Users can open and directly modify these files within Fusion 360 to suit their specific needs.

## Reporting Design Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##

To report issues with the designs, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo. Please reference the schematic, board files, and reference designs associated with the flaws, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo.
