# Silicon Labs Open 3D Print Prototypes #

3D printing plays a vital role in hardware prototyping, turning digital designs into physical models for testing form, fit, and function. While software defines behavior, the printed prototype validates real-world usability and design accuracy.

By sharing 3D-printable designs alongside software, we aim to support a complete development workflow—from concept to physical prototype—enabling faster iteration and innovation.

## Requirements ##

- 3D Design Software: Recommended to use [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio) for its simplicity and free of charge
- 3D printer

> [!Tip]
> Try to include .3mf files (3D Manufacturing Format), which is a modern file format designed specifically for 3D printing. It contains not only the model geometry but also additional information such as color, material, and print settings. These files have been edited using Bambu Studio and successfully test-printed with the Bambu A1 3D printer. It also contains design files created and finalized in Fusion 360, which provide full design history and parametric features. Users can open and directly modify these files within Fusion 360 to suit their specific needs.

## Reporting Design Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##

To report issues with the designs, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo. Please reference the schematic, board files, and reference designs associated with the flaws, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo.
