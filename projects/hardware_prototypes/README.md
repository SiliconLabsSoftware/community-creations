# Silicon Labs Open Hardware Prototypes #

Hardware design is a critical pillar of any embedded system, serving as the physical foundation upon which software operates. While software defines behavior and functionality, hardware determines the system's capabilities, performance, power efficiency, and reliability. A well-designed hardware platform ensures optimal integration with sensors, actuators, and communication interfaces, enabling the software to perform effectively in real-world conditions.

By sharing hardware resources alongside software, we aim to empower the community with a more holistic development environmentâ€”one that supports innovation from the circuit board to the application layer.
