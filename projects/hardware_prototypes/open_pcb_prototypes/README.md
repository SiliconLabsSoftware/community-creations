# Silicon Labs Open PCB Prototypes #

In embedded system development, PCB prototyping bridges the gap between concept and functional hardware. It allows engineers to validate circuit behavior, test component placement, and ensure signal integrity before committing to final production.

Unlike software, which can be iterated rapidly, hardware requires physical validation. Sharing PCB prototypes alongside firmware helps streamline development, reduce integration issues, and foster a more cohesive design processâ€”from schematic to system-level testing.

## Reporting Design Issues and Posting Questions and Comments ##

To report issues with the designs, please create a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo. Please reference the schematic, board files, and reference designs associated with the flaws, and reference line numbers. If you are proposing a fix, also include information on the proposed fix. Since these examples are provided as-is, there is no guarantee that these examples will be updated to fix these issues.

Questions and comments related to these examples should be made by creating a new "Issue" in the "Issues" section of this repo.
